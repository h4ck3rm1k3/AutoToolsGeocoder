If the account isn't publishing free/busy information correctly then I would suggest that it is reset. 

You will need to configure an Outlook client with the room as the default account in the profile. Once done, close Outlook completely.

Click Start, Run and ty

outlook.exe /cleanfreebusy

and press enter. 
That will reset the free/busy information.
